# 🧠 Computer Vision Projects with PyTorch & OpenCV

A collection of practical and research-inspired computer vision notebooks covering everything from basic convolutional networks to object detection and transformer-based models.

Built using:
- 🔧 PyTorch, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLO
- 📊 Custom Datasets, Transfer Learning
- 📈 Model Visualization, Experiment Tracking

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** These notebooks are based on various tutorials and learning materials I followed while learning PyTorch and computer vision. Some notebooks are inspired by or adapted from popular open-source courses, papers, and community projects. The work here reflects my learning journey and is not intended for commercial use.
