Extract the feature map area corresponding to the region proposals (note that when an image is passed through a VGG16 architecture, the image is downscaled by 32 at the output as there are 5 pooling operations performed. Thus if a region exists with a bounding box of (40,32,200,240) in the original image, the feature map corresponding to the bounding box of (5, 4, 25, 30) would correspond to the exact same region).\n","\n","4. Pass the feature maps corresponding to region proposals through th RoI (Region of Interest) pooling layer one at a time so that all feature maps of region proposals have a similar shape.
